        <h3 class="font1">The greatness of a person is estimated by tolerance in provoking situations.</h3>
        <p class="font1">
            <br>
            Every one of us tend to commit mistakes ,undergo atonements and moreover well known with one’s own deeds .However quite a few will keep a watch over it to avoid doing such actions. The reason why most of us couldn’t put a halt to it is we don’t shutdown the urge of speech ,mind  and body. Just like if one experiences indigestion by having processed food still he /she couldn’t stop consuming it, because of urge of the tongue.
            Human is distinguished from an animal by intelligence. Intelligence is shown by the self control. But one can’t fix up their mind and actions in a void because by nature we ought to seek happiness and it can’t be experienced without any sort of exchange. So it is inevitable to be surrounded by such urge and the only antidote for such a chaos is to tolerate and  direct one’s mind and actions in a proper way.
            <br>
            In Sanskrit urge is called vegam. There are six of such urges which keep on hampering oneself.
            <br>
            <b># urge of speech</b>
            <br>
            First goes control of the mouth to speak which is termed as vachovegam. We are adapted to such a culture where one speaks without any sense of thought which is termed as loose talk. But scripture says we shouldn’t speak where its not necessary. One shouldn’t speak in such a way that it will agitate the minds of others which is a part of austerity of speech. However controlling the speech doesn’t imply self-imposed silence.  A controlled speech advocates engaging the speaking process in inquiring on the self-realisation.

           <b>2# urge of mind</b> 
            <br>
            There is a great saying – the mind is the best friend for those who control it whereas it is a worst enemy for those who don’t. yogic practises are following by many these days in order to have a peaceful mind since mind is flickering all the time with a speed greater than the speed of the light. An unconquered mind serve the dictations of lust, anger, illusion etc. negating the thoughts by creating the vacuum is merely impossible by all king of yogic processes. A simplest solution for this restless mind to be conquered is engaging the thoughts in the supreme personality of godhead just like there is no darkness when there is sun similarly there is no question of mind being agitated .

            <b>3# uncontrollable anger</b>
            <br>
            Anger for the right cause is unstoppable. Tolerating the insults to one’s own self but enraging when others are blasphemed is the anger in the mode of goodness. So one can’t avoid the anger but can apply it rightly.
            <br> 
            <b>4# urge of tongue</b>
            <br>
            In one of the Vaishnava songs it is said that senses are the deadly enemies that collaborate with sense gratification. Of those senses tongue is the most voracious and hard to conquer. We are always accompanied by the demands of the tongue which in turn results in health issues. We shouldn’t allow the tongue to eat according to its choice but should control it by taking the right input.
            <br>

            <br>
            <b>5# urge of belly</b>
            <br>
            One must try to restrain the temporary temptations created by the tongue and belly. If one listens to the tongue, belly has to suffer.
            <br>
            <b>6# urge for opposite sex</b>
            <br>
            In the Vedic civilisation there are schools called gururkulas . this system is made such that there would be no illicit sex, sexual intercourse and sexual urge which is an instinct behaviour of a teenager. Modern civilisation has made everything topsy-turvy. In general genitals are meant to beget children, not for any kind of sexual activities. One has to overcome this by following the ancient practises without being so fancy and adopting a simple living and high thinking.
            <br>
            All in all in sikshashtakam it is said one should be more tolerant than a tree and devoid of all sense of false prestige. So one must try to inculcate this quality to focus on higher goal of life.
